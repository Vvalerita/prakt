She's screamin' sex and I heard that she's a dancer
Tequila kiss, come on, baby, won't you let me in
You, you're all I'm thinkin' about
I, I feel you pushin' up on me
I'm just the kind of boy to get you on the wall
Come on, baby, make it hot and dirty for me
(Don't stop girl, give it up girl)
(Don't stop girl, give it up girl)
Could you be my love, my love
Could you be my love, my love
I'll give you a taste of my love
Could you be my love, my love
Could you be my love
You're such a rush when I'm watchin' you dance low
And when we touch, I can feel your body lose control
You, you're all I'm thinkin' about
I, I feel you pushin' up on me
I'll be your fever, make you sweat, sweat, sweat (I got it, girl)
Let me see you break it down
Come and do me how you wanna be done
