She's screamin' sex and I heard that she's a dancer
Tequila kiss, come on, baby, won't you let me in
You, you're all I'm thinkin' about
I, I feel you pushin' up on me
I'm just the kind of boy to get you on the wall
Come on, baby, make it hot and dirty for me
(Don't stop girl, give it up girl)
(Don't stop girl, give it up girl)
Let me see you break it down
Come and do me how you wanna be done
